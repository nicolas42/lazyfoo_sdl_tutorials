			<p>Loopback gives you the power of a high-end studio mixing board right inside your computer, making it possible to route audio between applications with no physical wires required. Now you can control exactly how and where audio is heard on your Mac.</p>					
				
						
        	<h2>Getting Started</h2>

			<p>This manual provides you with a useful overview of the application, including an outline of the interface, as well as details on using the application. We recommend a quick read-through, but you can also just dive in if you like. Refer back here for assistance at any time, right from Loopback's <span class="uielement">Help</span> menu.</p>
 
		
        	<h2>Additional Assistance</h2>
        	
			<p>The following resources will supplement a read-through of the manual and help you get the answers you need.</p>

		<p>Loopback has a single main window which lists all of your current virtual audio devices in the device list on the left side. When you first launch Loopback, you'll see the <span class="uielement">Loopback Audio</span> device. This default device is automatically created and enabled when you first install Loopback.
		
		<h2>Creating and Deleting Virtual Audio Devices</h2>

			<br>Controls for adding and removing virtual audio devices
		</p>		
		
		<p>To create a new virtual audio device, just click the <span class="uielement">(+) New Virtual Device</span> button in the lower left corner of Loopback's main window. When you do, a new device will appear in the device list, already enabled and ready for further configuration as desired.</p>

		<p>To delete a virtual audio device entirely, highlight it in the list, then click the <span class="uielement">(-)</span> button. Note that device deletion can't be undone. You can, of course, create a new device.</p>
		
		<p>Rather than permanently deleting a device, you may instead wish to temporarily disable it.</p>
		
		<h2>Adjusting the Device Name</h2>
		
		<p>To adjust a virtual audio device's name, click the device in the <span class="uielement">Devices</span> list on the left side of Loopback's main window to select it. Once the device is selected, you'll be able to edit its name at the top of the <span class="uielement">Device Editor</span> area on the right side of Loopback's main window. Click the <span class="uielement">Edit pencil</span>, then type the new name, and press Return or click away to finalize the change.

			<br>The Name field for a Loopback device
		</p>
		
		<p>This name affects how the device will appear in audio input selectors throughout the system. Note that some applications may not immediately detect the new name. Toggling the virtual audio device off then back on in Loopback should cause the new name to be shown everywhere. If the old name still persists in an application, quit and relaunch that app to get the new device name to appear.</p>	
		
		<h2>Enabling and Disabling Virtual Audio Devices</h2>

		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/devicebasics-04.png" alt="Loopback's Enabled/Disable Checkbox" width="540" height="284" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>The “iTunes &amp; Mic” device is enabled;
			<br>The “Loopback Audio” device is disabled
		</p>	
		
		<p>Newly created virtual audio devices are enabled by default, so that they can be used immediately. To disable a device, toggle the <span class="uielement">On/Off</span> switch next to its name in the device list. To re-enable the device, toggle the slider back on.</p>
		
		<p>It may be useful to think of disabling a virtual audio device as the equivalent of unplugging a physical device from your computer. Likewise, enabling a virtual device is the equivalent of plugging a physical device into your computer.</p>	
		
		<h2>Set It and Forget It</h2>
		
		<p>The Loopback application does <em>not</em> need to be running for your virtual audio devices to appear throughout the system. Once you’ve created and configured things in Loopback, you can quit the app. The virtual audio device will persist, even across machine restarts.</p>

		<h2>Configure Your Devices</h2>

		<p>Next, learn how to configure your devices by reading the three pages in this manual's “Device Configuration” section. You'll see how to set which <a href="audiosources.html">audio sources</a> a virtual device pulls in, as well as how to adjust the number of <a href=channels.html"">output channels</a> it has (as well as how they're configured), and how to optionally <a href="monitors.html">monitor audio</a> coming through the virtual device.

    	<h1>Configuring Audio Sources</h1>
      
        <p>Virtual audio devices can be used as simple <a href="passthru.html">pass-thru</a> devices, but Loopback provides much more power by allowing you to configure audio from specific sources to flow through a device. This is done in the <span class="uielement">Sources</span> column of the <span class="uielement">Device Editor</span>.</p>
	
		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/audiosources-01.png" alt="An empty table device" width="540" height="200" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>The Sources column in its default state
		</p>
		
		<p>When a device is created, it will contain only the special Pass-Thru source. This allows audio to enter the device as input and be passed out as output, which allows audio to be piped directly between applications without any further configuration needed in Loopback. For more details on Pass-Thru, see the <a href="passthru.html">Notes on Pass-Thru</a> page.</p>
		
		<p>For more control, you can configure your virtual audio device to pull in audio from specific audio sources (both applications and physical devices). To add a source to a device, click the <span class="uielement">(+)</span> button at the top of the <span class="uielement">Sources</span> column, then select an application or audio device. Any audio produced by the source will then be included in the virtual audio device’s output.</p>
					
		<p>Below, you can see that we've added the software application iTunes to our device, as well as a USB microphone.</p>
				
		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/audiosources-02.png" alt="" width="540" height="500" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>The Sources column, with audio sources added
		</p>
		
		<p>Thanks to Loopback, the audio from all these sources will be combined into one virtual device.

		<h2>Additional Settings</h2>

		<h3>On/Off Toggle</h3>

		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/audiosources-03.png" alt="" width="240" height="310" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>The “iTunes” source is on, while the “USB Mic” source is off
		</p>

		<p>Using the <span class="uielement">On/Off</span> switch, you can toggle an individual audio source off. This enables you to temporarily exclude the source's audio from the virtual device without deleting the source and losing its configuration.</p>
		
		<h3>Volume Sliders</h3>
		
		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/audiosources-04.png" alt="" width="240" height="85" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>A source's volume slider
		</p>		
		
		<p>All source types (Applications, Audio Devices, and Pass-Thru) offer a volume slider under the <span class="uielement">Options</span> area. In general, leaving these at their default 100% level is best. If desired, you can use these sliders to adjust the relative level of audio provided by the source, as it compares to other sources in the virtual device.</p>
		
		<h3>Mute checkbox</h3>

		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/audiosources-05.png" alt="" width="240" height="69" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>An application's “Mute when capturing” checkbox
		</p>
		
		<p>Application sources feature a second setting in their <span class="uielement">Options</span> area: the <span class="uielement">Mute when capturing</span> checkbox. This checkbox is on by default, which means that when the virtual audio device is in use, audio from the application source will <em>not</em> be played through. This is usually desirable, as applications using the Loopback virtual audio device will frequently want to perform their own audio play-through, after some amount of processing.</p>
				
		<p>In most cases, you'll want to leave this checkbox in its default On state. However, if you want the audio from an application source to be audible regardless of how the virtual device is being used, you can toggle the checkbox off.</p> 

		<h2>Removing a Source</h2>

		<p>To remove an audio source from your virtual device, click on it in the editor to highlight it, then click the <span class="uielement">Delete</span> button in the bottom bar or select <span class="uielement">Delete</span> from the <span class="uielement">Edit</span> menu.</p>		
		
		<h2>Channel Mapping</h2>
		
		<p>By default, Loopback maps sources to output channels automatically. For details on adjusting this mapping, read over the <a href="outputchannels.html">Output Channels</a> page.</p>
		
			
		</div>
	</div><!-- main-->



	

	
		
	<div class="main">
		<div class="content">   
    	<h1>Configuring Output Channels</h1>
      
        <p>Physical audio devices usually have two or more channels, each of which can carry distinct audio. For example, a stereo microphone has both left and right channels, while more complex mixers may have 8, 16, or even more channels. Loopback's virtual audio devices start as 2 channel stereo devices, but they can be configured to have up to 64 channels.
        
        <p>Loopback handles some channel mapping automatically. When you add a source or monitor to a virtual device, its channels will be mapped one-to-one with the device's existing output channels, as possible. Similarly, when additional output channels are added, the Pass-Thru source is updated and auto-mapped to them. Note that mappings for application and audio device sources, as well as monitors, are not automatically modified when output channels are added.</p>
    	

		<h2>Manually Adjusting the Channel Mapping</h2>
		
		<p>Below, you'll see the automatic channel mapping for our device with iTunes and a USB microphone (for clarity, the Pass-Thru source has been removed). This automatic mapping will often be sufficient, but it's also possible to manually configure the virtual audio device's channel mapping, via the <span class="uielement">Channel Outputs</span> column.</p>

		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/channelmapping-01.png" alt="" width="540" height="354" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>A default channel mapping
		</p>
			
		<h3>Adding Output Channels</h3>			
			
		<p>As mentioned above, virtual audio devices initially have two channels. Using the <span class="uielement">(+)</span> button next to the <span class="uielement">Output Channels</span> column header, you can add channel pairs, up to a total of 64 channels.</p>
		
		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/channelmapping-02.png" alt="" width="240" height="240" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>A second pair of outputs has been added, but nothing maps to it yet.
		</p>		
		<h3>Re-Wiring Audio Flow</h3>	

		<p>Once your device has the desired number of channels, you can use the intuitive wiring system to configure your audio routing exactly as desired. To add a connection, click and drag from one wiring socket to another. As shown below, a wire will be drawn to visually demonstrate that a connection has been established.

		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/channelmapping-03.mov" alt="" width="540" height="158" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>Channel wiring, in action
		</p>		
	
		
		<p>Below, you can see that channels from iTunes and the USB mic have been manually mapped to four output channels.</p>

		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/channelmapping-04.png" alt="A configured device" width="540" height="354" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>A fully configured channel mapping
		</p>

		<p>In this setup, audio from the physical microphone's audio will be heard on channels 1 & 2, while iTunes audio will be heard on channels 3 and 4. Custom setups like this make it easy to record audio to distinct tracks, just based on the channels selected in your recording application.</p>	
		
		<h2>Removing Output Channels or Wiring</h2>

		<p>To remove a channel pair from your virtual device, click on it in the editor to highlight it, then click the <span class="uielement">Delete</span> button in the bottom bar or select <span class="uielement">Delete</span> from the <span class="uielement">Edit</span> menu.</p>				
		
		<p>Removing a connection between a source and an output channel, or between output channel and a monitor, is performed in similar fashion. Click the wire you wish to remove to highlight it, then click the <span class="uielement">Delete</span> button in the bottom bar or select <span class="uielement">Delete</span> from the <span class="uielement">Edit</span> menu.</p>	
		
		<h2>Monitors</h2>
		
		<p>Loopback devices can also be configured to include monitors, allowing you to use a secondary audio device to hear how your virtual device will sound. For details see the <a href="monitors.html">Monitors</a> page.</p>

    	<h1>Configuring Monitors</h1>
      
      
      		
		<h2>Monitors</h2>
		
		<p>Using the Monitors column, you can optionally direct audio from your virtual device to play through a secondary audio device. This can be useful for monitoring how your virtual device will sound to others.</p>
		
		<p>By default, Loopback's virtual audio devices do not include any monitors. To add a monitor to a virtual device, click the <span class="uielement">(+)</span> button at the top of the <span class="uielement">Monitors</span> column, then select an audio device.</p>
		
		<p>Below, you can see that we've added a monitor called “Built-in Output”. As a result, audio from the virtual device will now be heard through the monitor device.</p>

		</p>	
		

		<h2>Manually Adjusting the Monitoring Configuration</h2>
		
		<p>When a new monitor is added, Loopback will automatically map output channels to it, on a one-to-one basis, as possible. Any audio produced by the source will then be included in the virtual audio device’s output.</p>    		
		
		<p>You can also modify this wiring manually, using the same techniques described on the <a href="outputchannels.html">Output Channels</a> page.

			<br>The “Built-in Output” monitor is on.
			<br>The “USB Output” monitor is off.</p>

		<p>Using the <span class="uielement">On/Off</span> switch, you can toggle an individual monitoring device on or off, adjusting what you hear as needed.</p>
		
		<h3>Volume Sliders</h3>
		
		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/monitors-04.png" alt="" width="240" height="83" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>A monitor's volume slider
		</p>		
		
		<p>Monitors offer a volume slider under their <span class="uielement">Options</span> area, enabling you to control the volume level audio at which audio is heard.</p>

		<h3>Muted Application Sources</h3>
		
		<p>When a virtual device includes a monitor, it will be activated whenever ones of its sources is providing audio, even if no other application is using the device. This will in turn cause the <span class="uielement">Mute when capturing</span> setting for application sources to apply. As a result, audio may not be heard through the Mac's default output, but would be heard through the monitor device.</p>


		<h2>Removing a Monitor</h2>

		<p>To remove a monitor from your virtual device, click on it in the editor to highlight it, then click the <span class="uielement">Delete</span> button in the bottom bar or select <span class="uielement">Delete</span> from the <span class="uielement">Edit</span> menu.</p>	

		
		<h2>Device Usage</h2>

      	<h2>Selecting Virtual Audio Devices on Your System</h2>
    
		<p>Once a virtual audio device is enabled in Loopback, it's immediately ready for use by any application. You'll see the device in the <span class="uielement">Sound System Preferences</span>, under both the <span class="uielement">Output</span> and <span class="uielement">Input</span> tabs, as pictured here:</p>

			<br>A Loopback virtual audio device in the Sound System Preferences
		</p>
		
		<p>The virtual audio device will also appear in the device selectors for any audio applications which offer them. You'll be able to select the device as an audio input in Skype, FaceTime, GarageBand, and many other applications. 
		
		<p class="centeredimage">

		<h2>Adjusting Device Sample Rate</h2>
		
		<p>The initial sample rate for a newly created Loopback virtual audio device is determined by the system's current default output device. This sample rate can be changed at any time. This can be useful with higher fidelity audio, as increasing the sample rate is the only way to ensure the entire audio flow will not contain any lossy conversions.</p>
		
		<p>To change the sample rate of an enabled Loopback virtual audio device, open MacOS's <span class="uielement">Audio MIDI Setup</span> application (located in the <span class="uielement">Utilities</span> folder of your <span class="uielement">Applications</span> folder). Here, you can change the sample rate exactly as you would for an actual hardware audio device. Your Loopback virtual audio device will remember its new sample rate, even if it is later disabled and re-enabled.</p>

    	<h1>Pass-Thru Devices</h1>

		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/passthru-01.png" alt="" width="540" height="140">
		</p> 
		
		<p>Loopback virtual audio devices have the ability to function as both audio inputs and audio outputs. While all virtual devices will appear as inputs, the ability to appear as an available output is accomplished with Loopback's <span class="uielement">Pass-Thru</span> source. Appearing as an output device makes it possible to pipe audio directly between two applications. We refer to devices doing this as “pass-thru devices”.</p>
		
		<p>Some users may have previously used the tool “Soundflower” for similar audio routing between applications. Loopback modernizes the necessary infrastructure, providing a reliable method of passing audio directly between applications.</p>
		
        
        
		<h2>Creating a Simple Pass-Thru Device</h2>        
        
        <p>Any Loopback virtual audio device can function as a pass-thru device, as long as the <span class="uielement">Pass-Thru</span> source is present and enabled.	When you make a new Loopback virtual audio device (by clicking the <span class="uielement">New Virtual Device</span> button), the <span class="uielement">Pass-Thru</span> source is automatically included. If you like, you can rename the device to something like “Pass-Thru”, as we've done here. That's the extent of configuration that's required inside of Loopback.</p>

		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/passthru-02.png" alt="" width="540" height="240" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>A simple pass-thru device
		</p>              

		<p>This pass-thru device will appear on the system as both an audio output and an audio input. Any application with an audio output selector can feed audio into the pass-thru device, while any application with an audio input selector can pull it out.</p>
		
		<h3>Adding Audio to the Pass-Thru</h3>

        <p>To add audio to a pass-thru device, select it from the audio output selector inside the desired source application. Below, we sent audio into the device by adjusting an <span class="uielement">Output</span> block in our audio recording tool <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/">Audio Hijack</a>.</p>
        
		<p class="centeredimage">

			<br>Audio Hijack setting “Pass-Thru” as an audio output device
		</p> 
		
		<p>With this setting, audio from the Audio Hijack Session in question will be sent into the pass-thru device.</p>        

		<h3>Receiving Audio From the Pass-Thru</h3>

        <p>To receive audio from the pass-thru device, just select “Pass-Thru” as the audio <em>input</em> inside the desired source application. Now any audio being sent to “Pass-Thru” will be pulled in by your application.</p>
        
		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/passthru-04.png" alt="" width="540" height="200" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>Skype selecting “Pass-Thru” as its audio input</p>     		
		
		<p>Above, we've set the VoIP app Skype to pull audio out of the pass-thru device.</p>		
		
		<h3>Adjusting the Channel Count</h3>
		
		<p>When you add output channels to your Loopback virtual audio device, the Pass-Thru source will automatically gain channels as well. Those channels will be mapped one-to-one to the output channels, automatically. In this way, your virtual device will be able to take in up to 64 channels of input, and pass it through to 64 channels of output.</p>
		
		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/passthru-05.png" alt="" width="540" height="320" style="border-radius: 8px;">
			<br>A Pass-Thru device with 4 channels
		</p>   

		<p>It's unlikely you'd want anything but a one-to-one mapping of inputs to output channels, but do note that you can remove and reconfigure channel mappings if you desire.</p>



		<h2>Removing and Adding Pass-Thru Functionality in a Virtual Device</h2>
		
		<p>When a new Loopback device is created, it includes the <span class="uielement">Pass-Thru</span> source by default. With this source on, the device will appear as an output device, as well as an input device. 
			
		<p>If you don't want a device to appear as an output on your Mac, you can toggle the <span class="uielement">Pass-Thru</span> source off, or delete it entirely from the device.</p>
		
		<p>If you wish to restore a device's ability to be an output, just toggle the <span class="uielement">Pass-Thru</span> source back on, or re-add it using the <span class="uielement">Add Source</span> menu at the top of the <span class="uielement">Sources</span> column.</p>



		<h2>The Pass-Thru Source in Other Virtual Devices</h2>
		
		<p>It's generally best to use a Loopback virtual audio device as either a pass-thru, with no other sources, or as a fully configured device which skips the pass-thru functionality. Using your Loopback virtual audio devices in one of these two ways is the best way to avoid any confusion as far as your audio routing goes.</p>

		<p class="centeredimage">
			<img src="images/passthru-06.png" alt="" width="540" height="240" style="border-radius: 8px;">

			<br>A fully configured device
		</p>  		
		
		<p>That said, Loopback doesn't prevent you from using the <span class="uielement">Pass-thru</span> source alongside other configured audio sources. If you do, audio from the included sources will be pulled into the Loopback virtual audio device. If any other application has the Loopback virtual audio device set as an output, that application's audio will flow into the device as well.</p>

		<p>If you use Loopback and find you like it, please purchase a license key - support the software you use and love!</p>

		<p>To purchase your license key, just visit <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/store/">https://rogueamoeba.com/store/</a>.</p>		


		<h3>What about upgrades?</h3>
	
		<p>If you purchased a license for Loopback before September 1st, 2018 (your license key will start with <tt>CIRC-</tt>), you're eligible for a discounted upgrade to version 2.</p>

		<h2>Installing Loopback</h2>

We're always working to improve our products, so don't hesitate to tell us what was missing or didn't work for you. 

		<p>To remove Loopback, first select <span class="uielement">Uninstall ACE</span> from the <span class="uielement">Loopback</span> menu. You'll be walked through the process to remove Loopback's ACE (Audio Capture Engine) backend from the system.</p>

<h3>What that said:</h3> Don't sell this software directly for profit. If you want to distribute it, great! Just make sure it's unmodified from the download from our site. If you create a distribution package, it'd be cool if you sent a copy to the address above, though this is not required.
